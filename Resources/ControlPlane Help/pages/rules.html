                <p><img src="../gfx/rulesscreen.png"></p>
		<p><b>Rules</b> are how ControlPlane determines your
		context.  Rules can be created for any evidence source that you have enabled.
		</p>
                <p>Once an evidence source has been enabled ControlPlane will start collecting
                data for that data source and if appropriate, allow you to create rules.</p>

                <p><img src="../gfx/addrule.png"></p>

                <p>To add a rule simply choose what type of rule you wish to create
                and then configuration the available parameters.</p>

                <p><img src="../gfx/addiprule.png">
		</p>

                <p>The above example would create a new rule looking for 192.168.1.21 
                as an assigned IP address and apply the given confidence 
                towards the 'Automatic' context if an interface is assigned that IP.  
                Remember that a context can consist of many rules and rules can even overlap 
                with other contexts.  For the best results try to create rules that are highly
                indicative of where you are or what you are doing.  For example, if you are 
                assigned an IP of 192.168.1.x at work and at home, it probably isn't a good rule
                to use.  Try to find some other evidence source that more definitively places
                your laptop at a given location.
		</p>

		<p>Again, ControlPlane frequently evaluates all its rules, and finds the
		subset of rules that match. It combines all these rules to get
		a confidence for each context, and decides on the highest
		confidence context. If the confidence for that context is
		greater than a threshold (configurable in the Preferences
		window), and the context is not the current one, ControlPlane
		changes to that context, and triggers any relevant actions.
