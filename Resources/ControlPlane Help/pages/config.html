			<h1>Configuring ControlPlane</h1>
		</div>
		<p>This section deals with the overall configuration of
		ControlPlane; it doesn't cover <a href="rules.html">rules</a> or
		<a href="actions.html">actions</a>.
		</p>
		<p>ControlPlane runs from the <em>status bar</em> (the right-hand
		portion of the menu bar containing icons), and does not show in
		the Dock. You can access ControlPlane's preferences and other
		features through the ControlPlane icon.
		</p>

		<h2>Enabling automatic switching</h2>
		<p>The 'Enable automatic switching' option needs to checked in
		the General preferences for automatic switching to occur. Other
		functionality, such as forced switching, will still work if
		this option is unchecked.
		</p>
        
        <h2>Start ControlPlane at Login</h2>
        <p>Enable the 'Start ControlPlane' at login option to force ControlPlane to 
        start when you login.</p>
        
        <h2>Use Growl</h2>
        <p>The "Enable Growl" option enables or disables growl notifications of 
        context changes.</p>

		<h2>Hiding from status bar</h2>
		<p>If the 'Hide from status bar' option is checked in the
		General preferences, the ControlPlane icon in the status bar will
		disappear about 10 seconds after launching (or after enabling
		this option). To restore the icon to access preferences,
		simply relaunch ControlPlane, and the icon will be visible again
		for another 10 seconds.
		</p>
        
        <h2>Menu Bar Options</h2>
        <p>You can choose to show the icon, context or both the icon and text
        in the menu bar of your Mac.  Simply choose the option that best fits your
        needs.</p>

		<h2>Switch Smoothing</h2>
		<p>Some evidence sources in ControlPlane can occasionally return
		spurious data, either due to bad hardware (such as USB), or
		fundamentally unreliable physical circumstances (such as WiFi).
		This can sometimes cause ControlPlane to momentarily switch away
		from the current (correct) context, and then switch back once
		the evidence source corrects itself.
		</p>
		<p>If you check the 'Use switch smoothing' option in the
		General preferences, ControlPlane will delay all context
		switching until two consecutive rule evaluations both yield the
		same guess. The interval between rule evaluations defaults to
		five seconds, so using switch smoothing will delay legitimate
		context changes by this length of time.
		</p>

                <h2>Restore previous context when ControlPlane starts</h2>
                <p>If option is checked, ControlPlane will assume it is in the same 
                context when it starts as it was in when it was shutdown.  This will
                prevent ControlPlane from running any actions for that context again.  
                Unchecking this option will force ControlPlane to start from an unknown
                context at start time.  Unchecking this option is useful if you want to 
                rerun your actions after a reboot, particularly useful on a Mac that isn't 
                mobile.</p>

		<h2>Default Context</h2>
		<p>Sometimes ControlPlane doesn't have enough evidence to make a
		confident enough guess as to your correct context. You can
		specify a <em>default context</em> to be used in these
		situations.
		</p>

		<h2>Confidence required</h2>
		<p>After ControlPlane has combined all the matching rules, it
		arrives at a confidence for each possible context. The
		minimum confidence threshold is configurable via this slider.
