<p>ControlPlane brings context-aware computing to your portable Mac computer.
It allows your computer to determine its context by gathering evidence
from your environment (<b>evidence sources</b>), using flexible rules to make an educated guess (<b>rules</b>), and then
performing arbitrary actions upon changing context (<b>actions</b>).
</p>
<p>ControlPlane's concept of <em>contexts</em> is a generalization of a location,
and encompasses more than just where your computer is. A context might
represent what you are doing, or what else is going on around you.
</p>
<p>Contexts can also be nested to provide fine-grained control. For example,
your "Work" context might have two subcontexts called "Meeting" and "At Desk".
If you imagine all your contexts as a tree, transitions between contexts
involve "walking" that tree, leaving and entering a sequence of contexts.
</p>
<div class="taskbox">
	<p><strong>Example Scenario</strong><br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Work
		<ul>
			<li>Meeting</li>
			<li>Work</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Home
		<ul>
			<li>At Desk</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>A particular USB mouse might only be used at your work, so its
	presence is a strong indicator that your context should be "Work".
	Furthermore, if the room is also dark, you're probably in a meeting,
	so your context should be "Meeting", which is a subcontext of "Work".
	</p>
	<p>Similarly, a WiFi access point called "SmithNet" might be a good
	indicator that your context should be "Home", and being connected to a
	power adapter would also indicate that your context should be
	"At Desk", a subcontext of "Home".
